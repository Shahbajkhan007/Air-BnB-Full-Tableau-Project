# Air-BnB-Full-Tableau-Project

**Project Description: Analyzing Airbnb Listings in Seattle**

Data Source: The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle and pertains to Airbnb listings in Seattle. It includes various information distributed by zip codes.

Data Preparation: Initially, the listings and calendar data were downloaded separately from Kaggle and consolidated into a single Excel workbook. Using Tableau, the data was then imported and joined together using Tableau's built-in join functionality.

Visualizations:

Average Price per Zip Code: This visualization depicts the average price of listings per zip code on a map. It provides a spatial representation of listing prices across different areas in Seattle.
Price by Zip Code: A detailed breakdown showcasing the pricing distribution across various zip codes in Seattle.
Revenue for the Year: This visualization illustrates the total revenue generated by listings throughout the year on a weekly basis. It offers insights into revenue trends over time.
Average Price per Bedroom: Utilizing Tableau's capabilities, this visualization presents the average price of listings based on the number of bedrooms. It helps in understanding the pricing dynamics based on the type of accommodation.
Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings: This visualization utilizes the count distinct function in Tableau to showcase the distribution of listings based on the number of bedrooms. It provides an overview of the variety of accommodation options available.

Technical Approach: The project involved using Tableau's functionalities such as joins, mapping, calculations, and visualization techniques to create insightful dashboards from the dataset.

Data Management: Set of queries were run to preprocess the data before importing it into Tableau for visualization.

Sharing and Collaboration: The project contents were pushed from local to GitHub using Git commands, creating a Tableau Airbnb Seattle repository. Additionally, the dashboards were uploaded to Tableau Public Online for wider accessibility.
